## Chapter III: The Architecture of Brilliance

### The DATA Framework

_(Building a Logical Folder Structure)_

Holmes stepped to his blackboard with characteristic authority, chalk in hand like a conductor's baton.

"Lesser minds organize randomly, Watson—a folder for 'Stuff,' another for 'Important Things,' perhaps one labeled 'Miscellaneous' that becomes a digital junk drawer. The superior intellect follows what I call the DATA framework."

**Why Structure Matters (Even in a Connected System):**

"You might ask, Watson, why we need folders at all when notes can link freely. The answer lies in the fundamental difference between browsing and searching. When you browse your vault in the file explorer, you need logical groupings. When you search, the connections matter. We need both capabilities."

"The DATA framework serves multiple masters: your future self who must quickly locate information, colleagues who might need to navigate your system, and the natural cognitive patterns of organization that even the most brilliant minds require for efficiency."

**The DATA Framework Explained:**

**\`1 Delivery\`** - *Active work and completed projects*
- Why first? Because this is where you spend 80% of your time
- "Delivery" implies outcome-focused thinking
- Contains both active investigations and archived cases
- Think: "What am I delivering to the world?"

**\`2 Assets\`** - *The building blocks of knowledge*
- People, concepts, evidence, resources
- These are your reference materials—stable, reusable
- Like a well-organized library within your vault
- Think: "What resources do I draw upon repeatedly?"

**\`3 Timeline\`** - *When chronology matters more than connection*
- Daily notes, meeting records, periodic reviews
- For those moments when "when did this happen?" matters more than "how does this connect?"
- Provides a chronological backbone to complement your web of links
- Think: "What happened when, in sequence?"

**\`4 Arsenal\`** - *Tools, templates, configurations*
- The purely utilitarian elements
- Templates for consistent note-taking
- Images, attachments, configuration files
- Think: "What makes my system function smoothly?"

> [!info] DATA Framework
> The DATA Framework is my own idea, after testing multiple general-purpose structure. I am more than happy if you want to adopt it as well! I would however appreciate a brief mention if you also want to present it.

**Step-by-Step Folder Creation:**

1. **Right-click in the file explorer** (left sidebar of Obsidian)
2. **Select "New folder"** from the context menu
3. **Name it exactly**: \`1 Delivery\` (the number ensures proper ordering regardless of alphabetical sorting)
4. **Repeat for**: \`2 Assets\`, \`3 Timeline\`, \`4 Arsenal\`
5. **Observe the result**: Your folders now appear in logical order at the top of your file list

"This structure," Holmes continued with evident satisfaction, "serves both personal investigation and professional consultation. Though naturally, those of ordinary intellect might require separate vaults to prevent confusion."

**Advanced Organization (For Complex Cases):**

"The highest complexity I recommend—and I do not make recommendations lightly—appears thus:"

\`\`\`markdown
📁 Holmes-Vault/
├── 📁 1 Delivery/
│   ├── 📁 Active/
│   │   └── 📁 Vanishing-Venture-Capital/

\`\`\`

**Creating Subfolders (When You Need Them):**

1. **Right-click on any main folder** (like \`2 Assets\`)
2. **Select "New folder"**
3. **Create subfolders**: \`People\`, \`Concepts\`, etc.
4. **Keep it simple**: No more than 2-3 levels deep, or navigation becomes laborious

"Remember, Watson—this structure grows organically. Start simple, add complexity only when the volume of information demands it. A system that's too complex for your current needs is as useless as no system at all."

## Chapter IV: The Dramatis Personae

### Cataloguing the Players

_(Creating Rich, Connected People Notes)_

"Every investigation begins with proper documentation of the principals involved," Holmes declared, settling into his leather chair. "But we shan't create mere dossiers, Watson. We shall build living documents that grow richer with each case, each interaction, each deduction."

**Why People Notes Are Different:**

"Consider the difference, Watson, between a business card filed away and a relationship actively maintained. Traditional contact management stores static information—name, title, phone number. But human relationships are dynamic, contextual, interconnected."

"In our system, each person becomes a hub of knowledge. Every case they're involved in, every insight they provide, every connection they represent—all linked, all searchable, all contributing to a deeper understanding of the human networks that surround our investigations."

**Creating Your First Person Note (Sherlock Holmes):**

**Step 1: Navigate and Create**
1. **Click on the \`2 Assets\` folder** in your file explorer
2. **Right-click in the empty space** below any existing files
3. **Select "New note"**
4. **Name it**: \`Sherlock Holmes\` (the filename automatically becomes the note title)

**Step 2: Understanding Properties (Metadata)**
"Observe this elegant feature, Watson..." Holmes gestured to his screen.

1. **Type \`---\` on the first line** of your new note
2. **Press Enter** and type \`---\` again
3. **Position your cursor between the dashes**
4. **Watch the properties panel appear** on the right side of your screen

![screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dsalathe/obsidian-tutorial/main/obsidian-tutorial/images/Pasted%20image%2020250921144100.png)

**Why Properties Matter:**

"Properties, Watson, are metadata—data about data. They allow us to store structured information that can be searched, filtered, and analyzed. Think of them as the filing system within each note, allowing for both human-readable information and machine-processable data."

"A note without properties is like a criminal without fingerprints—identifiable, but lacking the precise markers that allow for systematic categorization and retrieval."

**Step 3: Add Structured Information**

**Copy this exact format into your Sherlock Holmes note:**

The world's only consulting detective. When the police are out of their depth—which is to say, always—they come to me.
\`\`\`

**Understanding Each Element:**

- **\`tags:\`** - Categories for this note (we'll explore tagging deeply in Part 3)
- **\`created:\`** - When you first documented this person (useful for chronological reference)
- **\`image:\`** - A visual reference (essential for quick recognition)
- **The horizontal lines** - Separate metadata from content visually
- **The image embed** - \`![Alt text](URL)\` displays the image within the note
- **The description** - Free-form text about this person

### Advanced Image Management

**The Local Image Advantage:**

"But Holmes," Watson interjected with uncharacteristic boldness, "what if that online image disappears? Surely a local image would be more reliable?"

Holmes raised an eyebrow. "Watson! For once, your paranoia serves a useful purpose. External links can break, servers can fail, and then your carefully crafted notes become studded with broken image icons. Observe the superior method."

**Step-by-Step Local Image Setup:**

**Create Dr. Watson's Note:**
1. **Right-click on your "Sherlock Holmes" note** in the file explorer
2. **Select "Make a copy"**
3. **Rename the copy**: \`Dr. John H. Watson\`
4. **Double-click to open** the new note

**Add a Local Image:**
1. **Find the image file** \`watson-profile.png\` [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dsalathe/obsidian-tutorial/refs/heads/main/obsidian-tutorial/images/watson-profile.png) (or download any portrait image)
2. **Copy the image** (Ctrl+C or right-click → Copy)
3. **Click in your Watson note** where you want the image
4. **Paste the image** (Ctrl+V)
5. **When prompted, name it**: \`watson-profile.png\`

![watson](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dsalathe/obsidian-tutorial/refs/heads/main/obsidian-tutorial/images/watson-profile.png)

**Update the note content:**

My steadfast companion and chronicler. Somewhat limited in deductive capacity, but possesses admirable loyalty and a gift for stating the obvious.
\`\`\`

**Organizing Your Images:**

"Now, Watson—and pay attention—we shall organize these images properly."

**Step 1: Create the Images Folder**
1. **Right-click on \`4 Arsenal\` folder**
2. **Select "New folder"**
3. **Name it**: \`images\`

**Step 2: Move the Image**
1. **Find \`watson-profile.png\`** in your main vault folder
2. **Drag it into** the \`4 Arsenal/images\` folder
3. **Notice**: The link in your note still works! Obsidian automatically updates all references.

"But Holmes! Won't that break all my references?"

Holmes smiled with insufferable smugness. "Check your note, dear fellow."

_[Watson discovers the link still works—Obsidian automatically maintains references]_

**Step 3: Configure Automatic Image Organization**

"The application is nearly as clever as I am, Watson. But we can make it even more efficient. Observe..."

1. **Click the Settings gear icon** (bottom-left corner of Obsidian)
2. **Navigate to**: \`Files and links\` in the left sidebar
3. **Find**: "Default location for new attachments"
4. **Select**: "In the folder specified below"
5. **Enter**: \`4 Arsenal/images\`
6. **Click**: "Close"

**Why This Matters:**

"Now any image you paste will automatically be filed correctly. Organization without effort—though of course, such convenience could never replace genuine intelligence."

"This configuration ensures that all future images, documents, and attachments are automatically placed in your Arsenal folder, keeping your main workspace clean while ensuring everything is systematically organized."

## Conclusion: The Architecture Is Complete

"Superb work, Watson," Holmes declared, surveying their newly organized vault with evident satisfaction. "We have now constructed a knowledge management system that would be the envy of Scotland Yard—if they possessed the intelligence to appreciate its elegance."

**What You've Accomplished:**

**1. Structural Mastery**: The DATA framework provides a logical foundation that scales from simple personal use to complex professional investigations.

**2. Advanced Documentation**: Your people notes contain metadata, images, and structured information that creates rich, searchable profiles.

**3. Efficient Workflows**: Automatic image organization and consistent folder structures eliminate friction while maintaining organization.

**4. Connected Foundation**: You now understand how to create systematic connections between all elements of your knowledge base.

**The Path to Mastery:**

"But Holmes," Watson interjected with growing confidence, "surely this is still just the foundation? What of the actual investigation methods—templates, advanced search, the mysterious 'graph view' you mentioned?"

Holmes's eyes gleamed with characteristic superiority. "Precisely! In Part 3, we shall deploy the advanced techniques that separate the brilliant from the merely competent:

- **Template mastery** for consistent, efficient documentation
- **The mystical graph view** that reveals hidden patterns in your knowledge
- **Advanced search and tagging** techniques that would make Scotland Yard weep with envy
- **And finally**—we shall begin our first proper investigation: the Case of the Vanishing Venture Capital"

**Your Assignment Before Part 3:**

1. **Create 3-5 more people notes** using the metadata structure you've learned
2. **Practice the DATA organization** by creating a few notes in each folder
3. **Experiment with local images** - add photos to your notes and watch them auto-organize
4. **Master the folder structure** by moving notes between folders and observing how organization aids discovery
5. **Link extensively** - connect your people notes to concepts, projects, or other relevant information

"Remember, Watson—superior organization is not about rigid rules, but about creating a system that amplifies rather than constrains your thinking. The architecture you've built today will serve you whether investigating criminal conspiracies or organizing your weekly meal plans."

"Remember, Watson—the difference between a good detective and a great one lies not in natural ability alone, but in the systematic application of superior methods. You now possess the architectural foundation of genius. In Part 3, we shall add the advanced techniques that will make you truly formidable."
