Welcome to the sixth and probably the most exciting part of this LSP series. After presenting the general architecture of the LSP server in Part 1, building up the core components along with the logging management system in Part 2, and designing a wrapper around the HOCON parser in Part 3, we'll now dive deeper into implementing a \`SchemaReader\`. This component takes a JSON Schema and provides a list of valid object definitions given a context path.
