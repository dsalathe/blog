## Chapter XIII: The Web of All Knowledge

### Beyond Internal Intelligence

"Watson," Holmes declared, pacing before the fireplace with renewed energy, "we have constructed a formidable internal intelligence system. Yet even the most perfectly organized vault contains only what we already know. True detective mastery requires seamless integration with the vast repositories of external knowledge."

> [!danger] The Limitation of Isolation
> "Consider the detective who relies solely on personal observations versus one who systematically incorporates public records, press accounts, and expert analysis. The difference is not merely additive—it's exponential."

> [!info] The Web Clipper Solution
> "Fortunately, the Obsidian Web Clipper transforms any webpage into a properly formatted, searchable note in your vault. External intelligence becomes as accessible as your personal observations."

### Establishing Your Research Pipeline

> 
> "Perfect! Only the essential information captured, with source attribution preserved."

### AI-Enhanced Intelligence Capture

"But Holmes," Watson ventured hesitantly, "what if I wanted the complete page content with an intelligent summary at the top? I realize it would require manual effort to craft such summaries..."

"Nonsense, Watson! Your instinct is sound, and the solution more elegant than you imagine. We live in an age where Large Language Models can summarize pages automatically."

> [!tip] AI-Powered Clipping
> Modern web clipping can leverage artificial intelligence to automatically generate summaries, extract key points, and even answer questions about captured content. This transforms passive archiving into active intelligence gathering.

> [!question]- How do I enable AI capabilities?
>
> 1. **Access Interpreter Settings**: Web Clipper settings > Interpreter tab
> 2. **Enable AI**: Click `Enable Interpreter`
> 3. **Add Provider**: Click `Google Gemini` and enter your API key (or see next step if you don't have one yet)
> 4. **Get API Key**: Visit [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/api-keys) to create a free key
> 5. **Configure Model**: Add `Gemini 2.5 Flash` or newer
> 
> ![Interpreter Configuration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dsalathe/obsidian-tutorial/main/obsidian-tutorial/images/ScreenshotResultPart6WebClipperInterpreterConfiguration.png)
> 
> 6. **Update Template**: Return to `Default` template and use this prompt in `Note content` (trim first space):
> 
> ```text
>  > [!abstract]+ {{"a summary of the page, maximum 5 words"}}
> {{"a summary of the page, maximum 5 sentences, markdown format."|blockquote}}
> 
> {{content}}
> ```
>
> 7. **Test Integration**: Return to any Wikipedia page (eg [Startup Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company)), ensure your Gemini model is selected, then `Add to Obsidian`

> "Magnificent! Automatic summarization, full content preservation, and proper formatting—all in a single operation."

### Privacy-Conscious AI Integration

"Watson," Holmes said, setting down his pipe with a thoughtful expression, "while cloud-based AI services offer remarkable convenience, the discerning detective must consider the implications of transmitting sensitive information to external servers."

"You mean the clipped content travels through their systems?" Watson asked with concern.

"Precisely! Every article, every snippet of research passes through remote infrastructure. For routine public information, this poses no concern. But consider the implications when clipping internal corporate documents, legal materials, or confidential case information."

> [!danger] The Privacy Consideration
> External AI services process your clipped content on remote servers. For sensitive investigations—whether personal, professional, or confidential—this presents potential privacy and compliance concerns.

"Fortunately," Holmes continued with satisfaction, "the solution is elegant: self-hosted AI models that process information locally, ensuring complete privacy while maintaining analytical capability."

### Understanding Self-Hosted AI Options

> [!info] Three Paths to Privacy
> The modern detective has three distinct approaches to self-hosted AI:
> 
> **1. Cloud Self-Hosting**: Deploy models on your organization's cloud infrastructure (Azure, AWS, GCP)
>
> **2. On-Premises Hosting**: Maintain models on your company's internal servers
>
> **3. Local Edge Computing**: Run models directly on your own machine (recommended for maximum privacy)

### Configuring Cloud or On-Premises AI

"For those working within organizations," Holmes explained, "the first two options typically involve coordination with your technical department."

> [!question]- How do I connect to cloud or on-premises AI?
> **Configuration Steps:**
> 1. **Access Web Clipper Settings**: Navigate to Interpreter tab
> 2. **Add Custom Provider**: Click `+` and select `Custom`
> 
> ![Custom Provider Configuration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dsalathe/obsidian-tutorial/main/obsidian-tutorial/images/ScreenshotResultPart6CustomProvider.png)
> 
> 3. **Obtain Credentials**: Contact your IT department for:
>    - API Endpoint URL
>    - API Key (if required)
>    - Model ID for the specific LLM deployment
> 4. **Configure Access**: For on-premises solutions, ensure you're connected via VPN or on-site network
> 5. **Add Model**: Input the specific Model ID as provided by your organization
> 6. **Test Connection**: Attempt a simple clip to verify functionality
> 
> **Provider Naming Convention:**
> - Cloud deployments: Use descriptive names like `MyCompany-Azure` or `Corporate-AWS`
> - On-premises: Use your organization name, e.g., `Acme-OnPrem`

"This approach," Holmes noted, "provides privacy while leveraging enterprise-grade infrastructure and compliance frameworks."

### Local AI with Ollama: Maximum Privacy

"However, Watson, for the truly independent detective—or when handling the most sensitive matters—nothing surpasses running AI directly on one's own machine."

> [!warning] Advanced User Territory
> Local AI deployment requires basic understanding of system configuration and hardware capabilities. If unfamiliar with command-line interfaces or system resources, consider cloud or on-premises options first.

> [!tip]- Local AI with Ollama: Complete Guide
> **Why Choose Local AI:**
> - **Absolute Privacy**: Content never leaves your machine
> - **No Usage Limits**: Unlimited processing without API costs
> - **Offline Capability**: Works without internet connection
> - **Domain Customization**: Fine-tune models for specific needs
> 
> **System Requirements:**
> - **Minimum**: 8GB RAM, modern multi-core CPU
> - **Recommended**: 16GB+ RAM, dedicated GPU (NVIDIA/AMD)
> - **Emerging Option**: Snapdragon X Elite CPUs efficiently run models without discrete GPU
> - **Storage**: 5-10GB per model
> 
> **Installation Process:**
> 
> **1. Install Ollama**
> - Visit [ollama.com](https://ollama.com)
> - Download installer for your platform (Windows/Mac/Linux)
> - Run installation following standard procedures
> 
> **2. Download Your First Model**
> Open terminal/command prompt and run:
> ```bash
> ollama pull llama3.2:3b
> ```
> *For better quality but slower processing, use `llama3.2:8b`*
> 
> **3. Optimize for Web Clipping**
> Increase context window based on available RAM:
> ```bash
> ollama run llama3.2
> >>> /set parameter num_ctx 8192
> Set parameter 'num_ctx' to '8192'
> >>> /save llama3-8k
> Created new model 'llama3-8k'
> >>> /bye
> ```
> 
> **4. Configure Web Clipper**
> - Settings > Interpreter > Add `Ollama` provider
> - Model name: `llama3-8k` (or your custom name)
> - URL: `http://localhost:11434` (default Ollama endpoint)
> 
> **5. Create Privacy-Optimized Template**
> - Duplicate your default template, name it `Local`
> - Position it as second option for easy access
> - Modify Interpreter Context for efficiency:
> 
> ```text
> {{content}}
> ```
> 
> ![Local AI Configuration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dsalathe/obsidian-tutorial/main/obsidian-tutorial/images/ScreenshotResultPart6WebClipperLocalConfiguration.png)
> 
> **6. Prevent AI Hallucinations**
> If summaries include invented information, reduce context:
> ```text
> {{content|slice:0,2000}}
> ```
> *This limits input to first 2000 characters—adjust based on results*

> [!success]- Local AI in Action
> Click on any wikipedia page of small size (eg [MVP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product))
> ![Local Processing Result](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dsalathe/obsidian-tutorial/main/obsidian-tutorial/images/ScreenshotResultPart6LocalLLM.png)
> 
> "Observe, Watson—complete privacy maintained while achieving intelligent content processing. The initial clip may take 30-60 seconds as the model loads into memory, but subsequent operations process rapidly."

### Choosing Your AI Strategy

"The question becomes," Holmes mused, "which approach suits your investigative practice?"

> [!question] Decision Framework
> **Choose Cloud/On-Premises If:**
> - Work within organizational compliance frameworks
> - Require enterprise-grade uptime and support
> - Need consistent performance across teams
> - Prefer managed infrastructure
> 
> **Choose Local AI If:**
> - Handle personally sensitive information
> - Require absolute privacy guarantees
> - Have adequate hardware resources
> - Value zero ongoing costs
> 
> **Choose External AI If:**
> - Process only public information
> - Require cutting-edge model capabilities
> - Prioritize convenience over privacy
> - Have limited local computing resources

"Remember," Holmes concluded, "privacy is not paranoia—it's professional responsibility. The method you choose should reflect both your needs and your principles."

### Integrating External Intelligence

"Observe the true power, Watson—every clipped article immediately connects to your existing investigation network."
